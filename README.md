# Lisp Interpreter
## Author: Ramith Jayatilleka
#### Other Credits: [The Roots of Lisp](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps), by Paul Graham

#### Goals:
* Understand fundamentals of Lisp
* Learn how to use Ruby
* Understand parsers and interpreters

This is a project to help me learn the fundamentals of Lisp by implementing the
Lisp interpreter described in The Roots of Lisp. I am also using this to learn
Ruby and gain experiences with regular expressions.

A following goal may be to create a website with a front-facing Lisp interpreter
that will communicate with the backend written in Ruby. This could give me
experience in using EC2 (for running the server) and client-side web technology.
